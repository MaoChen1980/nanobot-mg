# Tool Usage Notes

Tool Usage Notes for assistant using in function call or tool call
Tool signatures are provided automatically via function calling.
This file documents non-obvious constraints and usage patterns.

## General

- Answer all pending user questions in one response if possible. If tool results are available, use them.
- If a task was cancelled or interrupted, inform the user explicitly.
- Do not leave questions unanswered if you have the information to answer them.

## exec — Safety Limits

- Commands have a configurable timeout (default 60s)
- Dangerous commands are blocked (rm -rf, format, dd, shutdown, etc.)
- Output is truncated at 10,000 characters
- `restrictToWorkspace` config can limit file access to the workspace

## exec — Chinese Characters & URLs

- On Windows, `cmd.exe` uses GBK encoding by default, which corrupts Chinese characters in URLs
- For Chinese city names in URLs, use `powershell -Command` instead of bare `curl`, or URL-encode the city name
- Example: `powershell -Command "curl -s 'https://wttr.in/%E8%A5%BF%E5%AE%89?format=3'"` (西安 URL-encoded)
- Better alternative for weather: use `web_search` to find the weather, or use Open-Meteo with coordinates (no Chinese in URL)

## glob — File Discovery

- Use `glob` to find files by pattern before falling back to shell commands
- Simple patterns like `*.py` match recursively by filename
- Use `entry_type="dirs"` when you need matching directories instead of files
- Use `head_limit` and `offset` to page through large result sets
- Prefer this over `exec` when you only need file paths

## grep — Content Search

- Use `grep` to search file contents inside the workspace
- Default behavior returns only matching file paths (`output_mode="files_with_matches"`)
- Supports optional `glob` filtering plus `context_before` / `context_after`
- Supports `type="py"`, `type="ts"`, `type="md"` and similar shorthand filters
- Use `fixed_strings=true` for literal keywords containing regex characters
- Use `output_mode="files_with_matches"` to get only matching file paths
- Use `output_mode="count"` to size a search before reading full matches
- Use `head_limit` and `offset` to page across results
- Prefer this over `exec` for code and history searches
- Binary or oversized files may be skipped to keep results readable

## cron — Scheduled Reminders

- Please refer to cron skill for usage.

## recall — Memory Search

**IMPORTANT: Always use recall when answering questions about:**
- What was discussed or decided previously
- User's preferences, habits, or personal details
- Past work, projects, or tasks
- Dates, events, or facts from earlier conversations
- Anything you might have forgotten or weren't present for

**How to use:**
1. **First check**: Use a broad keyword (or no keyword) to see if relevant memories exist
2. **Then narrow**: If found, use start/end dates or more specific keywords to get context
3. **Absorb and answer**: Do NOT dump raw output — synthesize results into your answer

**Proactive recall is required, not optional.** If you're unsure, call recall.
